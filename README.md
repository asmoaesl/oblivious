# Oblivious
Oblivious is, in all of its glory, a terminal game the pretends to be, contrary the misleading name, The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim, not Oblivion. Don't sue me.

## Building The Game
Compiling the game is very easy. All you need is:
* A working internet connection
* The Rust compiler and Cargo package manager (https://rust-lang.org/)

Download the source code and put the folder somewhere on your computer. Open the folder in a terminal and within the oblivious folder, execute:
```sh
cargo run
```
The game will build in debug mode and begin running immediately.

### Install
```sh
cargo install --force --path .
```
Where you can then run the game from any open terminal window with `oblivious`.
