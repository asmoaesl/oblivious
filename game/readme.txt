This game is majorly incomplete and it is impossible to finish the first mission, "Unbounded".

The most developed branch is Ralof's, but neither are complete. I will be working to finish this game, but as I ran into some
nasty bugs while developing the clothing and armor systems, it became fairly difficult to continue programming.

In all, my game is 1,100+ lines of Rust code. It contains about 10 keys, weapons, clothes, and armor. Most of the code goes
into programming concepts of items, armor, weapons, and character traits. Ironically, most of those concepts are not achievable
in this prototype.

I put a lot of effort into the engine of the game, as in how it is processing commands.

TIP: for multiword item names, use quotes
